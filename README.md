# visualization-tool-for-electric-vehicle-charge-and-range-analysis
Data analytics is key to the growth of Electric Vehicles, integrating with hardware, software, and mechatronic systems.

 Electric vehicles (EVs) are reshaping the future of transportation with their sustainable and environmentally friendly approach. However, range anxiety and limited understanding of battery performance and charging behavior are major hurdles in EV adoption. This project addresses these concerns by creating an interactive data visualization tool using Tableau, helping stakeholders such as EV owners, manufacturers, researchers, and city planners analyze EV performance and charging patterns.

Purpose

The main purpose of the project is to provide a visual analytics platform that makes sense of complex EV usage data. With the increasing adoption of EVs, stakeholders need a way to visualize range efficiency, identify optimal charging patterns, and plan infrastructure enhancements. Tableauâ€™s interactive dashboard capabilities make it an ideal solution for this purpose.
